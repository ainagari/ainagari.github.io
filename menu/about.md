I completed my Bachelor's degree in Linguistics at the University of Barcelona in 2015. During my studies, I spent half a year in Saint Petersburg, Russia, with a generous Eranet-Mundus Mobility scholarship.

After that, I followed the Erasmus Mundus Master [Language and Communication Technologies](https://lct-master.org/), which took me to Saarland University (Saarbrücken, Germany) and the University of Malta (Msida, Malta), for a year each. My Master's thesis on near-synonymy can be found [here](https://github.com/ainagari/ainagari.github.io/blob/master/documents/AinaGari_MastersThesis_NearSynonymy.pdf).

During my studies, I worked as a research assistant in four occasions for the University of Barcelona, Pompeu Fabra University and the University of Saarland, working in different (computational) linguistics-related topics, such as corpus annotation.

I completed my PhD at the [LISN](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/) lab (former LIMSI), [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), under the supervision of Marianna Apidianaki and Alexandre Allauzen.
My thesis, defended in June 2021, addresses the representation of different aspects of word meaning in neural language models. It was part of the ANR [MultiSem](https://sites.google.com/view/multisem/home) project.

Before my current position, I was a postdoctoral researcher, first at [Télécom-Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) and then with the [ALMAnaCH](https://almanach.inria.fr/index-fr.html) team at INRIA Paris, with Chloé Clavel and Matthieu Labeau. 

My mother tongue is Catalan, I speak Spanish fluently; English, French and Russian decently enough, and some Italian and German. My name is pronounced `['ajnə]` and my two last names `[gə'ɾi su'ɫe]`.
